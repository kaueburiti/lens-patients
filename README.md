## How to Run ⚡️

```
$ yarn install // install dependencies
$ yarn start // start the frontend application
$ yarn mock-server // start the fake api server, you should run it in other tab.
```

## Technical observations 💻

### State Management 💾

I added the react-query instead of using some state management library as redux. Is a really simple case and I didn't any special or advanced configuration, I just used with all default configs.

### Tests 📡

Unfortunately I didn't had time to add tests, that's not something that I would do on my real development, but as long the goal here was a quick development of a prove of concept, I just prioritize the finishing a usable application.

### About Time ⏰

I really thank you for being so understanding about not delivering this last weekend. In fact, I was not expecting to receive such a fast answer with the exercise already on Saturday. So I just had some time on Monday and today. I would love to dedicate more time to this interface, but it's really hard to find time during the week 😕
